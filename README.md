# Wordly_OCR_C++

## Purpose
This project converts the project ["wordly_ocr"]() to Python or C++.

## Notes
If C++/Python doesn't have a library that matlab has, then I just use matlab's library. 

Library that C++ Code needs:
- OpenCV
- sqlite3
- base64

Libraries that Python Code needs:
- openCV 2.0
- matplotlib
- numpy
- os
- matlab.engine

## Reference
It base on the project "wordly_ocr" built by University of Arizona processor [Marek Rychlik](https://github.com/mrychlik)
